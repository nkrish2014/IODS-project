# About the project

This page is made as a part of my work in the Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS) course offered by University of Helsinki in Spring 2017.

Introduction to Open Data Science course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical methods using the language R. The course material and the contact classes provide an invaluable support to learn this topic. I am not only learning the material but also loving it.

A warm thanks to the course instructor and his support team for teaching  this  excellent course.
